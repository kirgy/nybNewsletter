# Description
nybNewsletter is a simple subscriber list management plugin for wordpress. Intended for those who simple want to collect a list of subscribers on their site and store them in a clean and clear seperate database table.

# Instructions
Install the plugin, activate it and use the following shortcode on your front-end to render a subscribe form:
*[nybnewsletter]*

The plugin will process form posts to any URL whilst activated, and store them in a database table. 

If you would rather not use the shortcode, you can generate your own form markup, and post to any URL. Use the following fields:

- nybNewletter_firstName
- nybNewletter_lastName
- nybNewletter_email
